# 📘 Application Architecture & Why Docker Matters  

## 1️⃣ Application Architecture  
Every application typically consists of three main layers:  

1. **User Interface (Frontend)** – End users interact with the application via the UI.  
   - *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue…*  

2. **Backend (Business Logic)** – Handles the core functionality and processing.  
   - *Java, Python, .NET, Node.js…*  

3. **Database (Storage)** – Stores and manages application data.  
   - *MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB…*  

➡️ Example Tech Stack: **Java (Backend) + MySQL (Database) + Angular 16 (Frontend) → Tomcat Server (Deployment)**  

---

## 2️⃣ Running an Application  
To run such an application, we must install and configure all required **dependencies** on the machine:  

- Java  
- MySQL  
- Angular CLI (Node.js runtime)  
- Tomcat server  

⚠️ **Problem:** When setting this up across multiple environments, issues often arise:  
- Version mismatches  
- Configuration errors  
- “Works on my machine” problems  

---

## 3️⃣ Application Environments  

- **DEV** → Developers test and integrate code  
- **SIT** → Testers perform System Integration Testing  
- **UAT** → Clients perform User Acceptance Testing (Go / No Go)  
- **PILOT** → Pre-production testing environment  
- **PROD** → Live environment (end users access the app)  

As a **DevOps Engineer**, you are responsible for ensuring consistent infrastructure setup across all these environments.  

---

## 4️⃣ The Challenge  
Manual installation of dependencies in every environment is:  
- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Difficult to maintain  
- Causes **dependency/version compatibility issues**  

---

## 5️⃣ Solutions  

Two approaches exist to simplify and standardize environment setup:  

### 🔹 Virtualization  
- Uses Virtual Machines (VMs)  
- Each VM runs its own OS + dependencies + application  
- **Cons:** Heavy, resource-intensive, slower startup  

### 🔹 Containerization  
- Uses lightweight, isolated **containers** that share the host OS  
- Containers include only the required dependencies + application  
- **Pros:** Lightweight, fast, portable, easy to replicate  

---

## 6️⃣ Why Docker?  

**Docker** is the most widely used **containerization platform**.  

- ✅ Ensures consistent environments across DEV → SIT → UAT → PILOT → PROD  
- ✅ Eliminates “works on my machine” issues  
- ✅ Speeds up deployments and scaling  
- ✅ Enables easy rollback/version control of environments  
- ✅ Saves infrastructure costs compared to VMs

# 🐳 Docker  

## What is Docker?  
- **Docker** is a free and open-source software/tool.  
- It is used for **Containerization** → allows us to run applications in **any machine** without worrying about environment setup.  

---

## What is a Container?  
- A **Container** = **Application Code + Application Dependencies**  
- Docker ensures all dependencies required by the app are included inside the container.  
- This removes the need to manually install dependencies on every system.  

---

## Why is Docker Important?  

### 🔹 Portability  
- Normally, applications fail to run across different environments due to version mismatches or missing dependencies.  
- With Docker, the **application + dependencies are packaged together**.  
- This means the same container can run on:  
  - Developer’s laptop  
  - Testing environment  
  - Production servers  
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)  

➡️ **Build Once, Run Anywhere**  

### 🔹 Other Benefits  
- Consistent environments across **DEV → SIT → UAT → PROD**  
- Eliminates the “Works on my machine” issue  
- Lightweight compared to Virtual Machines  
- Faster deployments and easy scaling

# 🐳 Docker Architecture  

Docker follows a **Client–Server architecture**. It consists of the following main components:  

---

## 1️⃣ Docker Client  
- The tool developers use to interact with Docker.  
- Sends commands to the **Docker Daemon** using REST APIs.  
- Example commands:  
  ```bash
  docker build
  docker run
  docker pull
  docker push
  ```
- Multiple clients can talk to the same daemon.
---

## 2️⃣ Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)  
- The **core service** that runs on the host machine.  
- Responsible for:  
  - Building and running containers  
  - Managing container lifecycle  
  - Handling images, networks, and volumes  
- Listens for requests from the Docker Client.  

---

## 3️⃣ Docker Objects  
Docker works with several objects:  

- **Images** → Read-only templates used to create containers (e.g., Ubuntu, MySQL, Nginx).  
- **Containers** → Running instances of images (your actual application).  
- **Volumes** → Used for persistent storage of data.  
- **Networks** → Enable communication between multiple containers.  

---

## 4️⃣ Docker Registry  
- A storage location for Docker images.  
- **Docker Hub** is the default public registry.  
- Private registries can also be used (e.g., enterprise).  
- Commands:  
  - `docker pull` → Download an image from a registry  
  - `docker push` → Upload an image to a registry  

---

## 🔄 Workflow Example  

1. Developer runs a command:  
   ```bash
   docker run nginx
   ```
2. Docker Client sends the request to the Docker Daemon.

3. Daemon checks if the nginx image exists locally:

   -  If not, it pulls the image from the Docker Registry.

4. Daemon creates a container from the image.

5. The container runs the application with all required dependencies.

# 🌟 Final Takeaway  
Without Docker → You manually install **Java, MySQL, Angular, Tomcat** on every environment (error-prone).  
With Docker → You **package everything** into containers → Same environment everywhere → **Build once, run anywhere**.
